Hindustan Unilever,'Buy and Forget' strategy for bluechip stocks simply does NOT work,i have given a framework and checklist on rindiagrowthstocks and be it mid cap or small cap or large cap if any stocks goes through that filter you will end up with high quality stocks and investment the large cap wont go a 100 bagger because of size at a mature or late stage you get a decent 1215 if you hold it for long time and the sector itself has a runway with small and madcap if they operate in sectors that have growth for long periods and they dominate in that sector then you get multi baggers because the pe expands from 21520 to 80 and eps grows at same pace for example polycab was a 810x because of the secular runway of fiberisation of whole india and pe was 20 so a reasonable valuation pe expanded a3 times and eps also expanded 34 times so we had a 10x return asian paints use to trade at 2025 pe and same goes for polycab and havells and so may other stocks before then run up now trading in 2023 at 8090 pe and growing at 1015 is not justified thats why they are underperforming because pe will revert back to mean same happened with bajaj it was a 80 pe stock and eps went 25 times but pe compressed to 27 thats why stock didnt move growth and long runway is essential for a stock to compound and one needs to invest it at reasonable valuations today most of mid and small are trading at 7080 pe so even with all the growth the valuations and price we pay for that growth is not justified,12,NEGATIVE,0.8995871543884277,2024-12-10 08:19:34
